For a potential job, I had to make a program that read an .exe file, extracted a video from it and do some things like adding text on a frame and some other things.
They were concepts I had no idea about. It involved some networking things and I have no experience in networking. So I tried learning some networking, following tutorials, and then attempted it for the project. I didn't entirely understand what the project description was asking me to do so I didn't complete it, so here's my unfinished mess!
